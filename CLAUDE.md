# Omnis App — Claude Reference

> Last updated: 2026-03-09 (Phase 1D). This file is the authoritative reference for Claude sessions working on this codebase.

## Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Framework | Next.js 16.1.6 (App Router, Turbopack) |
| UI | React 19, Tailwind CSS v4 |
| Auth | NextAuth v5 (`next-auth@5.0.0-beta.30`) — Credentials + JWT |
| ORM | Prisma v6.19.2 |
| Database | PostgreSQL via Supabase |
| AI | Anthropic Claude SDK (`@anthropic-ai/sdk`) |
| Language | TypeScript |

**Tailwind v4 note:** Uses `@import "tailwindcss"` in globals.css. Full class literals required (no dynamic construction) for the scanner to pick them up.

**Database connection:** `DATABASE_URL` in `.env.local` must use port **6543** (transaction mode pooler) with `?pgbouncer=true&connection_limit=5` to avoid `MaxClientsInSessionMode` errors. `DIRECT_URL` uses port 5432 for migrations.

---

## Environment

`.env.local` (required variables):
```
DATABASE_URL="...port 6543...?pgbouncer=true&connection_limit=5"
DIRECT_URL="...port 5432..."
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="..."
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="..."

## Auth & Session

```typescript
// JWT session shape (lib/auth.ts)
session.user = {
  id:         string   // User.id
  schoolId:   string
  schoolName: string
  role:       Role
  firstName:  string
  lastName:   string
}
```

Middleware (`middleware.ts`) protects all routes except `/login`. Role-based redirect:
- STUDENT → `/student/dashboard`
- PARENT → `/parent/dashboard`
- SENCO → `/send/dashboard`
- SLT / SCHOOL_ADMIN → `/slt/analytics`
- Others → `/dashboard`

## Outstanding Tasks

### ✅ Completed (this session)
- **Sidebar:** Lessons and Resources removed from TEACHER and HEAD_OF_DEPT nav
- **Analytics:** Classes tab added to `StudentAnalyticsView` with clickable rows drilling into student view
- **Homework:** `SetHomeworkModal` built — lesson picker, homework type chips, AI generation from lesson resources, class assignment, publish flow
- **Classes page:** `ClassListView` built; `seed-english-students.ts` added 20+22+22 students to 9E/En1, 10E/En2, 11E/En1 with realistic submissions
- **Account settings:** `/settings` page built with 5 tabs (Profile, Professional, Privacy, Sharing, Security); avatar upload to DB; avatar chip in sidebar links to `/settings`
- **Phase 1A — Oak content library:** Oak sync script (`scripts/oak-sync.ts`) completed — 19 subjects, 2,017 units, 11,403 lessons synced. `app/actions/oak.ts` created (getOakSubjects, searchOakLessons, getOakLesson, addOakLessonToLesson). `components/OakResourcePanel.tsx` built with filter/search UI. Integrated as "Oak Resources" tab in `LessonFolder.tsx`.
- **Phase 1C Part A — Wonde schema + synthetic data:** 12 Wonde MIS models added to `prisma/schema.prisma` with migration applied. `prisma/seed-wonde.ts` creates Oakfield Academy: 30 staff, 120 students (Y7–Y10), 204 contacts, 32 classes, 480 enrolments, 40 periods, 96 timetable entries, 240 KS2 SAT results.
- **Phase 1B — School Admin Dashboard:** 7 routes under `/admin/`, `app/actions/admin.ts` (8 actions), 6 components under `components/admin/`. SchoolCalendar schema model added + migration. SCHOOL_ADMIN sidebar updated. SCHOOL_ADMIN login now redirects to `/admin/dashboard`.
- **Phase 1D — SEND Resource Quality Scorer:** `SendQualityScore` Prisma model + migration (20260309110000). `app/actions/send-scorer.ts` (getOrCreateSendScore, forceRescoreLesson, getExistingScore, searchLessonsWithScores). 5 components under `components/send/` (SendScoreBadge, SendScoreCard, SendScoreButton, ScorerResultRow, ScorerView). Standalone page `/send-scorer` (SENCO + SLT + SCHOOL_ADMIN). SendScoreButton integrated into OakResourcePanel expanded detail. "Resource Scorer" added to SENCO sidebar nav. AI scoring via `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` across 5 dimensions (readability, visual load, cognitive, language, structure), scores cached in DB.

### 🔲 Still needed

**Analytics filter bar**
- `StudentAnalyticsView` has a filter bar but needs these specific dropdowns confirmed/added:
  - Subject, Year Group, Class, SEND status, Attainment band
- File: `components/StudentAnalyticsView.tsx` + `app/actions/analytics.ts` (`getAnalyticsFilters`)

**Marketing pages (4 pages as Next.js routes)**
- Add 4 public HTML pages as Next.js routes (do not require auth)
- Each page needs an email contact form that sends to `ivanyardley@me.com`
- Suggested routes: `/marketing/home`, `/marketing/features`, `/marketing/beta`, `/marketing/investors` (confirm exact routes with user)
- Install `resend` package for email sending

**Resend email API routes**
- Install: `npm install resend`
- Create `app/api/contact/beta/route.ts` — handles beta sign-up form submissions, sends email to `ivanyardley@me.com`
- Create `app/api/contact/investors/route.ts` — handles investor enquiry form submissions, sends email to `ivanyardley@me.com`
- Add `RESEND_API_KEY` to `.env.local`

**Unbuilt routes (currently show "Coming soon" via `not-found.tsx`)**
- `/lessons` — lesson library page
- `/resources` — resource library page
- `/classes` — partially built (list view exists, may need detail pages)
- `/plans` — SEND plans list/detail
- `/messages` — staff messaging inbox
- `/notifications` — notification centre
- `/hoy/integrity` — integrity case management
- `/admin/audit` — audit log (SCHOOL_ADMIN)
- `/slt/audit` — audit log (SLT)
- `/student/grades` — student grade history
- `/student/homework` — student homework list (individual items exist at `/student/homework/[id]`)
- `/cover/*` — cover manager pages

## Key Patterns & Gotchas

**Server actions:** All DB mutations live in `app/actions/`. Always `'use server'` at top. Session via `auth()` from `lib/auth.ts`.

**Multi-tenancy:** Every query must be scoped with `schoolId` from session. Never query without it.

**Prisma client:** Singleton in `lib/prisma.ts`. If server started before schema change, restart dev server or queries will fail silently.

**`SchoolClass.department`** is required (not nullable) in schema.

**Lesson `classId`** is optional — supports out-of-hours/club lessons.

**`createHomework` requires `setAt` and `dueAt`** as ISO strings, and sets `status: 'PUBLISHED'` by default.

**AI homework generation:** `generateHomeworkFromResources(lessonId, type)` in `app/actions/homework.ts` calls Claude with lesson title/objectives/resources as context. Falls back to template if API unavailable.

**SEND review:** Resources are automatically scored for SEND accessibility via `lib/sendReviewCached.ts` on upload. Score 0–100 stored in `ResourceReview.sendScore`.

**Avatar upload:** Stored as base64 data URL in `UserSettings.profilePictureUrl`. Max 5 MB, JPG/PNG only.

**Audit logging:** Use `writeAudit()` helper from `lib/prisma.ts` for all auditable actions.

**Dev server:** `npm run dev > /tmp/omnis-dev.log 2>&1 &` to run in background.
